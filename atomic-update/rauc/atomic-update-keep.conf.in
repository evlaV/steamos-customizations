## When an atomic update is applied, all changes made in /etc will be lost.
## The only exceptions are the files and directories listed below.
## If you want to preserve additional files, you can create drop-in '*.conf'
## files in "@atomic_update_conf_d@/".
## Indiscriminately preserving /etc files increases the risk of encountering
## unexpected behavior, please proceed only if you know what you are doing.
##
## Before /etc changes gets removed, a backup is created in @etc_backup_dir@
##
## The wildcard '*' will match every character, except forward slashes.
## The wildcard '**' is like '*', but it will include forward slashes.

## Eventual additional user drop-in configs
@atomic_update_conf_d@/*.conf

## IBus configuration
/etc/dconf/**

## Wi-Fi configuration
/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*

## Display manager configs
/etc/sddm.conf.d/*

## SSH public and private keys
/etc/ssh/*_key
/etc/ssh/*_key.pub

## Systemd enabled/disabled/masked services and mount units
/etc/systemd/system/*.wants/**
/etc/systemd/system/*.service
/etc/systemd/system/*.service.d/**
/etc/systemd/system/*.mount
/etc/systemd/system/*.mount.d/**

## Devkit canary file
/etc/.devkit-service-on-os-update

## Name of the machine
/etc/hostname

## Chosen Timezone
/etc/localtime

## This machine unique id
/etc/machine-id

## DNS configuration
/etc/resolv.conf

## Groups and users account information
/etc/group
/etc/gshadow
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow

/etc/subuid

## Atomic update development configuration
/etc/steamos-atomupd/client-dev.conf


## These examples include common files that users may wish to include.
#
## Please be careful with what you whitelist here -- `pacman -Syu` may touch
## these files and thus prevent atomic updates from adjusting them in the future.

## Keep changes to systemd config
# /etc/systemd/*.conf

## Keep drop-in changes for mkinitcpio
# /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/*.conf

## Keep all edits to any files.
## DANGEROUS! Any files you (or pacman) touch in /etc will forever shadow all
## upstream changes from future atomic updates, leading to hard to diagnose
## breakage. You get to keep the pieces.
