#  The purpose of holo-sync-var is to sync changes from the self install
#  to an updated install, either with or without creating backups. Backups are
#  created the first time we run with "all" option from rauc post-install.sh
#  but not during shutdown when any other minor changes are synced with "catchup"
#  option.
#
#  Usage:
#  holo-sync-var <all|catchup>
#
#  holo-sync-var all - Syncs changes from self /var, including the /etc overlay, to
#    the other partition. Generating also a backup of the /etc files
#
#  holo-sync-var catchup - Same as `all`, but without doing any of the backup steps.
