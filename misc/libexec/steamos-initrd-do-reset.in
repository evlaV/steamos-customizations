# Make sure we bail out if the reset fails at any stage.

# We do this to make sure the reset will be re-attempted or resumed
# if it does not complete here (possibly because the user got bored
# and leant on the power button)

# There is a small chance of a reset loop occurring if the reset cannot
# complete for fundamental reasons (unable to format filesystem and so
# forth) BUT
#
# a) the device is probably hosed anyway if this happens
#
# b) we care more about doing a genuine reset to stop leaking private
#    data / things worth actual €£$¥ to the next owner than we do about
#    [hopefully] unlikely reset loops

# We want to reset each filesystem in parallel _but_ we must wait for
# them to finish as we have to release all fds before the pivot to the
# real sysroot happens.
