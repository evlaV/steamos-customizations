This hook specifies the exact set of initrd modules required by the
steam deck (roughly what mkinitcpio autodetect would do, plus a few
modules we think would be useful for debugging/testing/vms).

It does this by piggybacking on the same mechanism as autodetect,
which means that it can be used alongside autodetect even if running
on a vm during the CI/build process.
